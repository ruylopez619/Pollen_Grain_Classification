# Pollen_Grain_Classification
Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of a collection of microscopic pollen grain images. It contains images of different types of pollen grains, each belonging to a specific plant species. The dataset is appropriately labeled to facilitate supervised learning tasks.

Models and Techniques
We have implemented and evaluated several classification models to identify the most effective approach for pollen grain classification. These models include (but are not limited to):
- Vision Transformer
- EfficentNet
- Swin Transformer
For each model, we have performed extensive testing and experimentation with different hyperparameters to identify the optimal configuration that yields the highest accuracy. The model selection process is based on comprehensive evaluations and comparisons of their performance on the dataset.

Data Augmentation
To further improve the robustness and generalization of our models, we have applied various data augmentation techniques. These techniques involve the creation of additional training samples by applying transformations such as rotation, flipping, scaling, and noise injection to the original images. The augmented data has proven to be instrumental in mitigating overfitting and enhancing the models' ability to accurately classify unseen pollen grain images.
